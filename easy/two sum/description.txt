Understanding the Problem:

We are given an array of integers nums and an integer target.
We need to find two numbers in the array that add up to the target.
We must return the indices of these two numbers.
Approach:

One common approach is to use a hashmap (JavaScript object) to store the difference between the target and each element of the array.
While iterating through the array, we check if the current element's complement (the difference) exists in the hashmap.
If it does, it means we have found the pair that adds up to the target.
