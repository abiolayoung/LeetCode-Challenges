Understanding the Problem:

We're given a singly linked list, which means each node has a reference to the next node in the list.
We need to find the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, we return the second middle node.
The number of nodes in the list is between 1 and 100, and each node has a value between 1 and 100.
Approach:

One common approach to finding the middle of a linked list is to use two pointers - a slow pointer and a fast pointer.
The slow pointer moves one node at a time while the fast pointer moves two nodes at a time.
When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle of the list.
Implementation:

Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both pointing to the head of the list.
Traverse the list with fast moving two steps at a time and slow moving one step at a time until fast reaches the end of the list.
When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle of the list.
Return the node where slow is pointing.
